# LeachForOmnet-4.3

LeachForOmnet-4.3 is a simulation of leach protocol for Omnet++ 4.3.

### Leach Protocol:
Low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy ("LEACH") is a TDMA-based MAC protocol which is integrated with clustering and a simple routing protocol in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

More information about Leach protocol:
-  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-energy_adaptive_clustering_hierarchy)
-  [Ijcsi](http://ijcsi.org/papers/IJCSI-10-1-1-354-359.pdf)

This implementation is mostly based on [this](http://ijcsi.org/papers/IJCSI-10-1-1-354-359.pdf) paper work.

### Omnet++

[Omnet++](https://omnetpp.org/) is a discrete event simulator. Omnet++ is extensible, modular, component-based C++ simulation library and framework, primarily for building network simulators.

This implementation is done on [Omnet++ 4.3](https://omnetpp.org/component/jdownloads/download/32-release-older-versions/2266-omnet-4-3-1-source-ide-tgz) for Windows.
